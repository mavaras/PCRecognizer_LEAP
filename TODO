PROBLEMS:
-> Window switch:
	-> sometimes u'"" isnt in list...
	-> that sleep(.5)
	-> Start as first element in list (Windows only?)
	-> velocity
	-> include moving into Alt-Tab menu

GUI
-> leap status (connected, focused, disconnected etc.)
-> "S" presesed = controll mode on
-> load configuration, save configuration
-> canvas tab (add gesture etc.)
-> colors, personalization
-> user manual (keywords etc.)

BACK
-> init at SO init (service ?)
-> alternate control system
   -> 1) the one that im working on now (dist_0_1 for click etc.)
   -> 2) other one most "real", most "attractive" "spectacular" (for example):
     -> selecting text doing a pinch with my fingers
	 -> mouse move with the center of the palm ?
	 -> swipe
   -> 3) face recognition... ?? if time

-> gesture actions
-> mouse control with different fingers or hand points
-> grab objects, improve things related like text selection etc.
-> really improve scrolling system (-scroll)
-> interact with applications
-> hand size, mouse vel, mouse acc etc. left or right hand...
-> little stupid things (keyboard, equalizer, visualizer etc.)

GENERAL
-> modularity
-> MVC
-> globals
-> data structures
-> controlled import sentences
-> setup.py
-> try Electron or any alternative web GUIs
